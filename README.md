**Analysis Approach**

**Data Preparation and Enhancement:**
- Inspect the data for NULL or missing values and apply appropriate data cleaning techniques.
- Ensure data integrity by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- Create new columns to generate additional insights from the existing data:
  - `time_of_day`: Categorize sales into Morning, Afternoon, and Evening to analyze peak sales times.
  - `day_name`: Extract the day of the week for each transaction to determine the busiest days.
  - `month_name`: Track sales and profitability trends by month.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Perform detailed analysis to address the project's objectives and answer key business questions.
